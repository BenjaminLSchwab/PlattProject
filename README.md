# PlattProject

   Hello Hiring Manager,
    
   Before my interview, I decided to get familiar with .NET Core by doing a small project. It is a mock inventory management system. This was meant to demonstrate 2 things. Firstly, I wanted to show that I am willing to put in the work to learn new technologies. This is by no means high level database design but I had never used .NET Core before (older versions of .NET only) so I had to do some research.
    Secondly, I remember Steve had mentioned that this role might involve executing raw SQL statements as opposed to using Entity Framework. This was something I was not experienced with, so I made sure to include some raw SQL in this project.
    'Populate Database' will create dummy data that includes some catalogue items, users, and warehouses, along with a randomly generated purchase history.
